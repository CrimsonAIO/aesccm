# aesccm
Counter with CBC-MAC (CCM) mode, as defined in
[NIST Special Publication SP 800-38C](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-38c/final)
([RFC 3610](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3610)).

Check out the example on [The Go Playground](https://play.golang.org/p/56rBEUS_zdP).
It shows how to encrypt and decrypt, and shows what happens when the cipher text
has been changed (tampered.)
